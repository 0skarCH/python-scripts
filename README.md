With this coffee barista you can order from your favorite coffee bar, The Early Sunlight!

The barista will ask you for your name, what order you would like and how many coffees. However there is someone very evil, Evil Ben. Evil Ben wants to shop but he doesn't have a good intention. He want's to hack into our beautiful coffee bar... So there are if statements to block Evil Ben and ones you enter your name as Ben the program stops. But there is more, Ben knows already that he can't get in so he asks his evil friend Dean. But luckly for us ones you enter Deans name the program stops too. But there is an easteregg, if you enter a specific name you will turn into GOD mode and all your coffees will be free! (Hint: you have to look at the code to know what the name is. Can you find it?)

Feel free to adjust the code to your likings like changing the price, menu, ... I only ask you one thing, NEVER EVER let evil Ben and evil Dean into your coffee bar because then the best coffee... Disappears...
